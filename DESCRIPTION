Description: Functions to prepare and analyse aerial LIDAR data. Written for
  the Centre for Environmental Risk Management of Bushfires, University of 
  Wollongong, Australia. Most functions are wrappers around those in the lidR
  package. The package may be freely used by anyone, but please note that: (1) 
  Some functions are particular to data conventions used by New South Wales 
  State Government and might not be suitable for general use; (2) The package
  is at an early stage of development and features are likely to change
  without notice between successive 0.x versions.
