\title{Check whether a LAS tile object has been prepared}
\usage{
is_prepared_tile(las)
}
\arguments{
\item{las}{A LAS object, e.g. imported using \code{prepare_tile}.}
}
\value{
TRUE if the tile has been prepared or FALSE otherwise.
}
\description{
When a LAS tile is imported using the \code{prepare_tile} function,
point heights are normalized relative to ground elevation and flight lines
are identified. This results in two extra columns (Zref and flightlineID)
being added to the LAS data table. This function checks that these two
columns are present. It also checks that the tile has point data, returning
FALSE if the point cloud is empty.
