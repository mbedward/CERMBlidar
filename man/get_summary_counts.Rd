\title{Create raster layers summarizing point counts for a LAS tile}
\usage{
get_summary_counts(las, res = 10, classes = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{las}{A LAS object, e.g. imported using \code{prepare_tile}.}

\item{res}{Raster cell size. The default value is 10 which assumes that
the LAS data is in a projected coordinate system with metres as units.}

\item{classes}{An integer vector specifying the point classes to summarize.
May include 2 (ground), 3 (low veg), 4 (mid veg), 5 (high veg), 35 (all veg
- the three vegetation classes combined), 6 (buildings) and 9 (water). The
default is to summarize all of the above.}
}
\value{
A \code{RasterStack} with a layer for each requested attribute.
}
\description{
Given a LAS tile and a raster cell size, this function creates raster layers
where cell values in each layer are point counts over all heights for a given
point class. A layer can also be created for all three vegetation classes
combined. The resulting layers are returned as a \code{RasterStack} object.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Get summary counts at 10m raster cell size for all supported
# point classes
rcounts <- get_summary_counts(las)

# Get summary counts for ground and combined vegetation classes
# at 2m resolution
rcounts <- get_summary_counts(las, res = 2, classes = c("ground", "allveg"))
}

}
