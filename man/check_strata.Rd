This function is used by \code{\link{get_stratum_counts}}. It checks that:
\itemize{
  \item The object is a data frame with (at least) three columns labelled:
    label, lowerht, upperht. Column order and case of names does not matter.
  \item All stratum upper heights are greater than lower heights.
  \item No two strata overlap (gaps between strata are permitted).
}
An error results if any of these conditions are not met.
